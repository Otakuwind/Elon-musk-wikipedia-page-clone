In 1995, Musk, his brother Kimbal, and Greg Kouri founded Zip2. Errol Musk provided them with $28,000 in funding.The company developed an Internet city guide with 
maps, directions, and yellow pages, and marketed it to newspapers.
Later in 1999, Musk co-founded X.com, an online financial services and e-mail payment company. X.com was one of the first federally insured online banks and over 
200,000 customers joined after its initial months of operation. Even though Musk founded the company, investors regarded him as inexperienced and replaced him with 
Intuit CEO Bill Harris by the end of the year.

<p>With $100 million of his own money,Musk founded SpaceX in May 2002 and became the company's CEO and Chief Engineer.</p>

<p>Tesla, Inc.—originally Tesla Motors—was incorporated in 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, who financed the company until the Series A round of funding. 
Both men played active roles in the company's early development prior to Musk's involvement.Musk led the Series A round of investment in February 2004; he 
invested $6.5 million, became the majority shareholder, and joined Tesla's board of directors as chairman. Musk took an active role within the company and oversaw 
Roadster product design but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations.</p>

<p>In 2016, Musk co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology startup company, with an investment of $100 million.Neuralink aims to integrate the human brain with 
artificial intelligence (AI) by creating devices that are embedded in the brain to facilitate its merging with machines. Such technology could enhance memory or allow 
the devices to communicate with software.The company also hopes to develop devices with which to treat neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, 
dementia, and spinal cord injuries.</p>

<p>Musk is president of the Musk Foundation, whose stated purpose is to: provide solar-power energy systems in disaster areas; support research, development, and 
advocacy (for interests including human space exploration, pediatrics, renewable energy and "safe artificial intelligence"); and support science and engineering 
educational efforts. From 2002 to 2018, the foundation gave out $25 million directly to non-profits, nearly half of which went to Musk's OpenAI, which was at the time 
a non-profit organization.</p>

<p>
From the early 2000s until late 2020, Musk resided in California, where both Tesla and SpaceX were founded. In 2020, he moved to Texas, stating that California had 
become "complacent" about its economic success. While hosting Saturday Night Live in May 2021, Musk stated that he has Asperger syndrome. He received some criticism 
from autism self-advocates for using the term since "Asperger syndrome" had been deprecated in the DSM-5, and its diagnosis subsumed under the broader category of 
autism spectrum disorder.</p>
